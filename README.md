# 🚗 Car Data Analysis Project

This repository contains the complete code, data, and documentation for a comprehensive **Car Data Analysis** project. The analysis was performed on a dataset containing information about 5000 cars, with the goal of uncovering insights related to car pricing, condition, demand, brand popularity, and ownership trends. It also includes statistical testing and predictive modeling using machine learning techniques.

## 📊 Project Overview

**Objective:**  
To explore and analyze a car dataset to extract meaningful insights and build a predictive model for car prices using linear regression.

## 📄 About the Dataset

- **Total Records:** 5000  
- **Features Include:**  
  - Car brand, model, mileage, engine size, condition, number of owners  
  - Market demand classification (high/low)  
  - Popularity score (0–10)  
  - Country of origin  
  - Car price  

**Analyses Performed:**
- Descriptive Statistics  
- Market Demand by Brand  
- Condition vs. Number of Owners  
- Count of Brands by Country  
- Car Condition Distribution by Brand
